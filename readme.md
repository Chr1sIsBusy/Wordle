While I did mostly follow a tutorial to make this there is my own code in there. The guide wanted me to use a freemium sort of API's where it was free up to so many calls and then it would charge my card but I don't like giving my card out to things that are supposed to be free so I found different APIs, had to figure out how to connect them, and eventually coming up solutions like including using a node module instead of an API which I believe to be faster then making an API request. That said there is still an API at use because it's important I have examples to use in the future. This is the project where I began to understand Javascript a lot more and why node.js is so helpful and what API's even are. I am proud of this one.

### To use
Make sure you have node.js installed.

1. Open new terminal and type in ``npm run start:backend``.

2. Open index.html and should work from there.


I would like that to start automatically but I'm still learning.
