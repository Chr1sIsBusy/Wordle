### Rules

A basic clone of wordle, user has six chances to guess the correct word and depending on the word entered itâ€™ll respond whether user has the correct letters in the right spaces, correct letters in wrong spaces, or just wrong letters. It sends each entered word to an API to check if it is a legitimate english word and if not it will not let user retry word.
